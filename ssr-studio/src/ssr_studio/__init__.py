SSR Studio - Self-Play SWE-RL Demo & Research Platform

A platform that demonstrates and operationalizes SSR-style self-play in sandboxed codebases:
an agent that can create its own executable training tasks (bugs + oracle tests) and learn
to solve them, forming a credible step toward self-evolving autonomous agentic SDLC.

Based on: "Toward Training Superintelligent Software Agents through Self-Play SWE-RL"
